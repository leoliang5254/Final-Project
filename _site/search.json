    "text": "2. Data Acquisition\nTo obtain rail system alert data from the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA), I used a web scraping approach. The CTA publishes system status and alerts on its website, but the site blocks automated web requests from R. Because of this, direct scraping from the live URL was not possible.\nTo preserve the web scraping method while avoiding server restrictions, I downloaded the full HTML of the CTA System Status & Alerts page using a standard web browser. I then used the rvest package in R to parse and extract structured rail alert information directly from the saved HTML file. This method still demonstrates the core principles of web scraping: navigating HTML structure, selecting elements with CSS selectors, and transforming the extracted content into a usable dataset.\nWeb scrapping\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages({\n  library(tidyverse)\n  library(rvest)\n})\n\nhtml &lt;- read_html(\"System Status & Alerts - CTA.html\")\n\nrail_block &lt;- html |&gt;\n  html_element(\"div#aRailAlerts table.tblsysalrt\") |&gt;\n  html_elements(\"tr\")\n\nrail_rows &lt;- rail_block[-1]\n\nroute &lt;- rail_rows |&gt;\n  html_element(\"td:nth-child(1) a\") |&gt;\n  html_text2()\n\nroute_url &lt;- rail_rows |&gt;\n  html_element(\"td:nth-child(1) a\") |&gt;\n  html_attr(\"href\")\n\nstatus &lt;- rail_rows |&gt;\n  html_element(\"td:nth-child(2)\") |&gt;\n  html_text2()\n\nrail_alerts &lt;- tibble(\n  mode = \"rail\",\n  route,\n  route_url,\n  status\n)\n\nrail_alerts\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 4\n  mode  route       route_url                                  status        \n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;                                      &lt;chr&gt;         \n1 rail  Red Line    https://www.transitchicago.com/redline/    Normal Service\n2 rail  Blue Line   https://www.transitchicago.com/blueline/   Special Note  \n3 rail  Brown Line  https://www.transitchicago.com/brownline/  Normal Service\n4 rail  Green Line  https://www.transitchicago.com/greenline/  Special Note  \n5 rail  Orange Line https://www.transitchicago.com/orangeline/ Normal Service\n6 rail  Pink Line   https://www.transitchicago.com/pinkline/   Normal Service\n7 rail  Purple Line https://www.transitchicago.com/purpleline/ Normal Service\n8 rail  Yellow Line https://www.transitchicago.com/yellowline/ Normal Service\n\n\nThe scraped dataset will serve as the foundation for subsequent steps, including data cleaning, visualization, and the analysis of how rail conditions vary across Chicago’s neighborhoods and populations."

    "text": "3. Data Wrangling and Quality Evaluation\nAfter scraping the rail alerts from the CTA System Status & Alerts page, I performed a series of wrangling steps to prepare the data set for analysis. The raw scraped data included the rail line name, a hyperlink to CTA’s route page, and a status description for each rail line. Although the data set is relatively small, it still required cleaning and structuring to ensure consistency and analytical usefulness.\nFirst, I standardized variable names, trimmed whitespace, and removed any non-informative rows. I then extracted key components of the service status, such as distinguishing between “Normal Service,” “Minor Delays,” and other operational statuses. Standardizing these values enables more reliable grouping and comparison across rail lines.\nNext, I evaluated data quality issues that commonly arise in scraped data. These included inconsistent status wording across lines, potential missing values, and whether the hyperlink fields were complete. Although the CTA’s website provides a structured table, the text content is not fully standardized, so additional transformation was needed to categorize alerts into meaningful groups.\nFrom an equity and fairness perspective, it was important to assess whether the data was complete and representative of the full CTA rail network. I checked whether all major rail lines appeared in the data set and whether any had missing or ambiguous service status fields. Missing values or incomplete alerts could bias subsequent analysis of transit reliability. These checks help ensure that the data set is suitable for exploring how service quality may differ across communities served by different rail lines.\nThe cleaned data set resulting from this step provides a structured, consistent input for visualization and analysis in later sections.\n3.1 Cleaning and Standardizing Variables\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nrail_clean &lt;- rail_alerts |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    route = str_squish(route),\n    status = str_squish(status),\n    route_url = str_squish(route_url)\n  )\nrail_clean\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 4\n  mode  route       route_url                                  status        \n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;                                      &lt;chr&gt;         \n1 rail  Red Line    https://www.transitchicago.com/redline/    Normal Service\n2 rail  Blue Line   https://www.transitchicago.com/blueline/   Special Note  \n3 rail  Brown Line  https://www.transitchicago.com/brownline/  Normal Service\n4 rail  Green Line  https://www.transitchicago.com/greenline/  Special Note  \n5 rail  Orange Line https://www.transitchicago.com/orangeline/ Normal Service\n6 rail  Pink Line   https://www.transitchicago.com/pinkline/   Normal Service\n7 rail  Purple Line https://www.transitchicago.com/purpleline/ Normal Service\n8 rail  Yellow Line https://www.transitchicago.com/yellowline/ Normal Service\n\n\n3.2 Creating a Standardized Status Category\n\nrail_clean &lt;- rail_clean |&gt;\nmutate(\nstatus_lower = str_to_lower(status),\nstatus_cat = case_when(\n  str_detect(status_lower, \"normal\") ~ \"normal\",\n  str_detect(status_lower, \"minor\") ~ \"minor_delay\",\n  str_detect(status_lower, \"delay\") ~ \"major_delay\",\n  str_detect(status_lower, \"reroute|slow zone|work\") ~ \"service_change\",\n  TRUE ~ \"unknown\"\n  )\n)\n\nrail_clean\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 6\n  mode  route       route_url                     status status_lower status_cat\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;                         &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;     \n1 rail  Red Line    https://www.transitchicago.c… Norma… normal serv… normal    \n2 rail  Blue Line   https://www.transitchicago.c… Speci… special note unknown   \n3 rail  Brown Line  https://www.transitchicago.c… Norma… normal serv… normal    \n4 rail  Green Line  https://www.transitchicago.c… Speci… special note unknown   \n5 rail  Orange Line https://www.transitchicago.c… Norma… normal serv… normal    \n6 rail  Pink Line   https://www.transitchicago.c… Norma… normal serv… normal    \n7 rail  Purple Line https://www.transitchicago.c… Norma… normal serv… normal    \n8 rail  Yellow Line https://www.transitchicago.c… Norma… normal serv… normal    \n\n\n3.3 Checking for Missing or Inconsistent Data\n\n# Missing values across each variable\n\nrail_clean |&gt; summarise(across(everything(), ~sum(is.na(.))))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 6\n   mode route route_url status status_lower status_cat\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;     &lt;int&gt;  &lt;int&gt;        &lt;int&gt;      &lt;int&gt;\n1     0     0         0      0            0          0\n\n\n\n# Raw status text overview\n\nrail_clean |&gt; count(status, sort = TRUE)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  status             n\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;int&gt;\n1 Normal Service     6\n2 Special Note       2\n\n\n\n# Standardized category counts\n\nrail_clean |&gt; count(status_cat, sort = TRUE)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  status_cat     n\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;int&gt;\n1 normal         6\n2 unknown        2\n\n\n3.4 Checking for Missing Rail Lines\n\nexpected_lines &lt;- c(\n\"Red Line\",\"Blue Line\",\"Brown Line\",\"Green Line\",\"Orange Line\",\n\"Purple Line\",\"Purple Line Express\",\"Pink Line\",\"Yellow Line\"\n)\n\nmissing_lines &lt;- setdiff(expected_lines, rail_clean$route)\nmissing_lines\n\n[1] \"Purple Line Express\"\n\n\n3.5 Structural Summary of the Cleaned Data set\n\nglimpse(rail_clean)\n\nRows: 8\nColumns: 6\n$ mode         &lt;chr&gt; \"rail\", \"rail\", \"rail\", \"rail\", \"rail\", \"rail\", \"rail\", \"…\n$ route        &lt;chr&gt; \"Red Line\", \"Blue Line\", \"Brown Line\", \"Green Line\", \"Ora…\n$ route_url    &lt;chr&gt; \"https://www.transitchicago.com/redline/\", \"https://www.t…\n$ status       &lt;chr&gt; \"Normal Service\", \"Special Note\", \"Normal Service\", \"Spec…\n$ status_lower &lt;chr&gt; \"normal service\", \"special note\", \"normal service\", \"spec…\n$ status_cat   &lt;chr&gt; \"normal\", \"unknown\", \"normal\", \"unknown\", \"normal\", \"norm…\n\n\n3.6 Fairness and Data Quality Considerations\nSeveral equity and quality issues emerged during the wrangling process:\n\nMissing Lines: Not all rail lines appear in the scraped table.

    "text": "5. Advanced Analysis: Clustering Rail Lines Using Machine Learning\nFor the advanced analysis component, I applied a machine learning method to group CTA rail lines based on their service conditions. Because the data set is relatively small and primarily categorical, I used unsupervised clustering (k-means) to identify patterns across lines using features derived from the standardized service status categories.\nThe main idea is to summarize, for each rail line, how many alerts fall into each status category (e.g., normal, minor delay, major delay, service change). These features form a simple numeric profile of the service conditions for each line. K-means clustering is then used to group lines with similar profiles. This approach does not rely on labeled outcome data and is appropriate for exploratory analysis of service patterns.\n5.1 Creating Feature Vectors for Each Rail Line\nFirst, I created a summary data set with counts of alerts by status category for each rail line. These counts are used as features for clustering.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nrail_features &lt;- rail_clean |&gt;\ncount(route, status_cat) |&gt;\ntidyr::pivot_wider(\nnames_from = status_cat,\nvalues_from = n,\nvalues_fill = 0\n)\n\nrail_features\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 3\n  route       unknown normal\n  &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;int&gt;  &lt;int&gt;\n1 Blue Line         1      0\n2 Brown Line        0      1\n3 Green Line        1      0\n4 Orange Line       0      1\n5 Pink Line         0      1\n6 Purple Line       0      1\n7 Red Line          0      1\n8 Yellow Line       0      1\n\n\nThis produces a table where each row is a rail line and each column is the count of alerts in a particular category\n5.2 Running K-Means Clustering\nBecause k-means requires the number of clusters to be no greater than the number of distinct feature profiles, I set the number of clusters to:\nmin(3, number of distinct feature patterns)\nThis prevents errors and ensures meaningful clusters.\n\nfeature_matrix &lt;- rail_features |&gt;\nselect(-route) |&gt;\nas.matrix()\n\nn_distinct &lt;- feature_matrix |&gt;\nas.data.frame() |&gt;\ndistinct() |&gt;\nnrow()\n\nn_distinct\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\nn_clusters &lt;- min(3, n_distinct)\n\nn_clusters\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\nif (n_clusters &gt; 1) {\nset.seed(446)\n\nk_result &lt;- kmeans(feature_matrix, centers = n_clusters)\n\nk_result\n\nrail_clusters &lt;- rail_features |&gt;\nmutate(cluster = k_result$cluster)\n\n} else {\nrail_clusters &lt;- rail_features |&gt;\nmutate(cluster = 1)\n}\n\nrail_clusters\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 4\n  route       unknown normal cluster\n  &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;int&gt;  &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt;\n1 Blue Line         1      0       2\n2 Brown Line        0      1       1\n3 Green Line        1      0       2\n4 Orange Line       0      1       1\n5 Pink Line         0      1       1\n6 Purple Line       0      1       1\n7 Red Line          0      1       1\n8 Yellow Line       0      1       1\n\n\n5.3 Merging Cluster Labels Into the Cleaned Dataset\n\nrail_clustered &lt;- rail_clean |&gt;\nleft_join(\nrail_clusters |&gt; select(route, cluster),\nby = \"route\"\n)\n\nrail_clustered\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 7\n  mode  route       route_url             status status_lower status_cat cluster\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;int&gt;\n1 rail  Red Line    https://www.transitc… Norma… normal serv… normal           1\n2 rail  Blue Line   https://www.transitc… Speci… special note unknown          2\n3 rail  Brown Line  https://www.transitc… Norma… normal serv… normal           1\n4 rail  Green Line  https://www.transitc… Speci… special note unknown          2\n5 rail  Orange Line https://www.transitc… Norma… normal serv… normal           1\n6 rail  Pink Line   https://www.transitc… Norma… normal serv… normal           1\n7 rail  Purple Line https://www.transitc… Norma… normal serv… normal           1\n8 rail  Yellow Line https://www.transitc… Norma… normal serv… normal           1\n\n\nBecause the data set is small and some rail lines share identical status profiles, I set the number of clusters equal to the smaller of three and the number of distinct feature profiles to avoid specifying more clusters than unique data points.\n5.4 Visualizing Cluster Results\nPlot 1: Rail Lines by Cluster\n\nrail_clusters |&gt;\nggplot(aes(x = reorder(route, cluster), y = as.factor(cluster))) +\ngeom_point(size = 4) +\nlabs(\ntitle = \"K-Means Clusters of CTA Rail Lines\",\nx = \"Rail Line\",\ny = \"Cluster\"\n) +\ntheme_minimal() +\ntheme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot 2: Status Distribution Within Each Cluster\nThis plot compares how different clusters are composed in terms of service status categories.\n\nrail_clustered |&gt;\ncount(cluster, status_cat) |&gt;\nggplot(aes(x = status_cat, y = n, fill = as.factor(cluster))) +\ngeom_col(position = \"dodge\") +\nlabs(\ntitle = \"Distribution of Status Categories by Cluster\",\nx = \"Service Status Category\",\ny = \"Count\",\nfill = \"Cluster\"\n) +\ntheme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.5 Interpretation of Machine Learning Results\n\nThe k-means algorithm grouped rail lines based on how many alerts they had in each status category.\nLines with similar operational patterns appear in the same cluster.\nSome clusters may reflect lines experiencing primarily normal service, while others may reflect lines with more construction-related disruptions or operational delays.\nBecause the data set is a snapshot, clusters suggest short-term operational similarities, not long-term reliability trends.\n\n5.6 Fairness and Limitations\n\nSnapshot bias: The analysis reflects conditions only for the moment the HTML was scraped, not long-term performance.\nSmall data set: With limited alerts and a small number of rail lines, clusters should be interpreted cautiously.\nReporting bias: CTA’s website communicates certain alerts differently across lines. Differences in reporting may influence clusters.\nEquity implications: Lines serving marginalized communities could appear more frequently in “disrupted” clusters—however, drawing these conclusions responsibly requires historical and demographic data that is beyond the scraped data set.\n\nDespite these limitations, the machine learning approach offers a structured way to compare service conditions across rail lines using reproducible, data-driven methods."
