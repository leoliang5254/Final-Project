    "text": "This Quarto site presents a reproducible data analysis project examining CTA rail service conditions in Chicago. The goal of the project is to explore how public transit service reliability is communicated through CTA’s system alerts and to demonstrate how data science methods can support conversations about transit equity, operational planning, and transparency.\nThe project uses publicly available information from CTA’s “System Status & Alerts” webpage. The data was collected through web scraping, cleaned and categorized into meaningful service status types, and then analyzed using exploratory machine learning techniques. Although the dataset represents only a single point in time, the workflow highlights how civic analysts, students, and public agencies can use reproducible tools to better understand transit service patterns."

    "text": "2. Data Acquisition\nTo obtain rail system alert data from the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA), I used a web scraping approach. The CTA publishes system status and alerts on its website, but the site blocks automated web requests from R. Because of this, direct scraping from the live URL was not possible.\nTo preserve the web scraping method while avoiding server restrictions, I downloaded the full HTML of the CTA System Status & Alerts page using a standard web browser. I then used the rvest package in R to parse and extract structured rail alert information directly from the saved HTML file. This method still demonstrates the core principles of web scraping: navigating HTML structure, selecting elements with CSS selectors, and transforming the extracted content into a usable data set.\nWeb scrapping\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages({\n  library(tidyverse)\n  library(rvest)\n})\n\nhtml &lt;- read_html(\"System Status & Alerts - CTA.html\")\n\nrail_block &lt;- html |&gt;\n  html_element(\"div#aRailAlerts table.tblsysalrt\") |&gt;\n  html_elements(\"tr\")\n\nrail_rows &lt;- rail_block[-1]\n\nroute &lt;- rail_rows |&gt;\n  html_element(\"td:nth-child(1) a\") |&gt;\n  html_text2()\n\nroute_url &lt;- rail_rows |&gt;\n  html_element(\"td:nth-child(1) a\") |&gt;\n  html_attr(\"href\")\n\nstatus &lt;- rail_rows |&gt;\n  html_element(\"td:nth-child(2)\") |&gt;\n  html_text2()\n\nrail_alerts &lt;- tibble(\n  mode = \"rail\",\n  route,\n  route_url,\n  status\n)\n\nrail_alerts\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 4\n  mode  route       route_url                                  status        \n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;                                      &lt;chr&gt;         \n1 rail  Red Line    https://www.transitchicago.com/redline/    Normal Service\n2 rail  Blue Line   https://www.transitchicago.com/blueline/   Special Note  \n3 rail  Brown Line  https://www.transitchicago.com/brownline/  Normal Service\n4 rail  Green Line  https://www.transitchicago.com/greenline/  Special Note  \n5 rail  Orange Line https://www.transitchicago.com/orangeline/ Normal Service\n6 rail  Pink Line   https://www.transitchicago.com/pinkline/   Normal Service\n7 rail  Purple Line https://www.transitchicago.com/purpleline/ Normal Service\n8 rail  Yellow Line https://www.transitchicago.com/yellowline/ Normal Service\n\n\nThe scraped data set will serve as the foundation for subsequent steps, including data cleaning, visualization, and the analysis of how rail conditions vary across Chicago’s neighborhoods and populations."

    "text": "3. Data Wrangling and Quality Evaluation\nAfter scraping the rail alerts from the CTA System Status & Alerts page, I performed a series of wrangling steps to prepare the data set for analysis. The raw scraped data included the rail line name, a hyperlink to CTA’s route page, and a status description for each rail line. Although the data set is relatively small, it still required cleaning and structuring to ensure consistency and analytically usefulness.\nFirst, I standardized variable names, trimmed white space, and removed any non-informative rows. I then extracted key components of the service status, such as distinguishing between “Normal Service,” “Minor Delays,” and other operational statuses. Standardizing these values enables more reliable grouping and comparison across rail lines.\nNext, I evaluated data quality issues that commonly arise in scraped data. These included inconsistent status wording across lines, potential missing values, and whether the hyperlink fields were complete. Although the CTA’s website provides a structured table, the text content is not fully standardized, so additional transformation was needed to categorize alerts into meaningful groups.\nFrom an equity and fairness perspective, it was important to assess whether the data was complete and representative of the full CTA rail network. I checked whether all major rail lines appeared in the data set and whether any had missing or ambiguous service status fields. Missing values or incomplete alerts could bias subsequent analysis of transit reliability. These checks help ensure that the data set is suitable for exploring how service quality may differ across communities served by different rail lines.\nThe cleaned data set resulting from this step provides a structured, consistent input for visualization and analysis in later sections.\n3.1 Cleaning and Standardizing Variables\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nrail_clean &lt;- rail_alerts |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    route = str_squish(route),\n    status = str_squish(status),\n    route_url = str_squish(route_url)\n  )\nrail_clean\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 4\n  mode  route       route_url                                  status        \n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;                                      &lt;chr&gt;         \n1 rail  Red Line    https://www.transitchicago.com/redline/    Normal Service\n2 rail  Blue Line   https://www.transitchicago.com/blueline/   Special Note  \n3 rail  Brown Line  https://www.transitchicago.com/brownline/  Normal Service\n4 rail  Green Line  https://www.transitchicago.com/greenline/  Special Note  \n5 rail  Orange Line https://www.transitchicago.com/orangeline/ Normal Service\n6 rail  Pink Line   https://www.transitchicago.com/pinkline/   Normal Service\n7 rail  Purple Line https://www.transitchicago.com/purpleline/ Normal Service\n8 rail  Yellow Line https://www.transitchicago.com/yellowline/ Normal Service\n\n\n3.2 Creating a Standardized Status Category\n\nrail_clean &lt;- rail_clean |&gt;\nmutate(\nstatus_lower = str_to_lower(status),\nstatus_cat = case_when(\n  str_detect(status_lower, \"normal\") ~ \"normal\",\n  str_detect(status_lower, \"minor\") ~ \"minor_delay\",\n  str_detect(status_lower, \"delay\") ~ \"major_delay\",\n  str_detect(status_lower, \"reroute|slow zone|work\") ~ \"service_change\",\n  TRUE ~ \"unknown\"\n  )\n)\n\nrail_clean\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 6\n  mode  route       route_url                     status status_lower status_cat\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;                         &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;     \n1 rail  Red Line    https://www.transitchicago.c… Norma… normal serv… normal    \n2 rail  Blue Line   https://www.transitchicago.c… Speci… special note unknown   \n3 rail  Brown Line  https://www.transitchicago.c… Norma… normal serv… normal    \n4 rail  Green Line  https://www.transitchicago.c… Speci… special note unknown   \n5 rail  Orange Line https://www.transitchicago.c… Norma… normal serv… normal    \n6 rail  Pink Line   https://www.transitchicago.c… Norma… normal serv… normal    \n7 rail  Purple Line https://www.transitchicago.c… Norma… normal serv… normal    \n8 rail  Yellow Line https://www.transitchicago.c… Norma… normal serv… normal    \n\n\n3.3 Checking for Missing or Inconsistent Data\n\n# Missing values across each variable\n\nrail_clean |&gt; summarise(across(everything(), ~sum(is.na(.))))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 6\n   mode route route_url status status_lower status_cat\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;     &lt;int&gt;  &lt;int&gt;        &lt;int&gt;      &lt;int&gt;\n1     0     0         0      0            0          0\n\n\n\n# Raw status text overview\n\nrail_clean |&gt; count(status, sort = TRUE)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  status             n\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;int&gt;\n1 Normal Service     6\n2 Special Note       2\n\n\n\n# Standardized category counts\n\nrail_clean |&gt; count(status_cat, sort = TRUE)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  status_cat     n\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;int&gt;\n1 normal         6\n2 unknown        2\n\n\n3.4 Checking for Missing Rail Lines\n\nexpected_lines &lt;- c(\n\"Red Line\",\"Blue Line\",\"Brown Line\",\"Green Line\",\"Orange Line\",\n\"Purple Line\",\"Purple Line Express\",\"Pink Line\",\"Yellow Line\"\n)\n\nmissing_lines &lt;- setdiff(expected_lines, rail_clean$route)\nmissing_lines\n\n[1] \"Purple Line Express\"\n\n\n3.5 Structural Summary of the Cleaned Data set\n\nglimpse(rail_clean)\n\nRows: 8\nColumns: 6\n$ mode         &lt;chr&gt; \"rail\", \"rail\", \"rail\", \"rail\", \"rail\", \"rail\", \"rail\", \"…\n$ route        &lt;chr&gt; \"Red Line\", \"Blue Line\", \"Brown Line\", \"Green Line\", \"Ora…\n$ route_url    &lt;chr&gt; \"https://www.transitchicago.com/redline/\", \"https://www.t…\n$ status       &lt;chr&gt; \"Normal Service\", \"Special Note\", \"Normal Service\", \"Spec…\n$ status_lower &lt;chr&gt; \"normal service\", \"special note\", \"normal service\", \"spec…\n$ status_cat   &lt;chr&gt; \"normal\", \"unknown\", \"normal\", \"unknown\", \"normal\", \"norm…\n\n\n3.6 Fairness and Data Quality Considerations\nSeveral equity and quality issues emerged during the wrangling process:\n\nMissing Lines: Not all rail lines appear in the scraped table.

    "text": "5. Advanced Analysis: Clustering Rail Lines Using Machine Learning\nFor the advanced analysis component, I applied a machine learning method to group CTA rail lines based on their service conditions. Because the data set is relatively small and primarily categorical, I used unsupervised clustering (k-means) to identify patterns across lines using features derived from the standardized service status categories.\nThe main idea is to summarize, for each rail line, how many alerts fall into each status category (e.g., normal, minor delay, major delay, service change). These features form a simple numeric profile of the service conditions for each line. K-means clustering is then used to group lines with similar profiles. This approach does not rely on labeled outcome data and is appropriate for exploratory analysis of service patterns.\n5.1 Creating Feature Vectors for Each Rail Line\nFirst, I created a summary data set with counts of alerts by status category for each rail line. These counts are used as features for clustering.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nrail_features &lt;- rail_clean |&gt;\ncount(route, status_cat) |&gt;\ntidyr::pivot_wider(\nnames_from = status_cat,\nvalues_from = n,\nvalues_fill = 0\n)\n\nrail_features\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 3\n  route       unknown normal\n  &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;int&gt;  &lt;int&gt;\n1 Blue Line         1      0\n2 Brown Line        0      1\n3 Green Line        1      0\n4 Orange Line       0      1\n5 Pink Line         0      1\n6 Purple Line       0      1\n7 Red Line          0      1\n8 Yellow Line       0      1\n\n\nThis produces a table where each row is a rail line and each column is the count of alerts in a particular category\n5.2 Running K-Means Clustering\nBecause k-means requires the number of clusters to be no greater than the number of distinct feature profiles, I set the number of clusters to:\nmin(3, number of distinct feature patterns)\nThis prevents errors and ensures meaningful clusters.\n\nfeature_matrix &lt;- rail_features |&gt;\nselect(-route) |&gt;\nas.matrix()\n\nn_distinct &lt;- feature_matrix |&gt;\nas.data.frame() |&gt;\ndistinct() |&gt;\nnrow()\n\nn_distinct\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\nn_clusters &lt;- min(3, n_distinct)\n\nn_clusters\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\nif (n_clusters &gt; 1) {\nset.seed(446)\n\nk_result &lt;- kmeans(feature_matrix, centers = n_clusters)\n\nk_result\n\nrail_clusters &lt;- rail_features |&gt;\nmutate(cluster = k_result$cluster)\n\n} else {\nrail_clusters &lt;- rail_features |&gt;\nmutate(cluster = 1)\n}\n\nrail_clusters\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 4\n  route       unknown normal cluster\n  &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;int&gt;  &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt;\n1 Blue Line         1      0       2\n2 Brown Line        0      1       1\n3 Green Line        1      0       2\n4 Orange Line       0      1       1\n5 Pink Line         0      1       1\n6 Purple Line       0      1       1\n7 Red Line          0      1       1\n8 Yellow Line       0      1       1\n\n\n5.3 Merging Cluster Labels Into the Cleaned Dataset\n\nrail_clustered &lt;- rail_clean |&gt;\nleft_join(\nrail_clusters |&gt; select(route, cluster),\nby = \"route\"\n)\n\nrail_clustered\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 7\n  mode  route       route_url             status status_lower status_cat cluster\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;int&gt;\n1 rail  Red Line    https://www.transitc… Norma… normal serv… normal           1\n2 rail  Blue Line   https://www.transitc… Speci… special note unknown          2\n3 rail  Brown Line  https://www.transitc… Norma… normal serv… normal           1\n4 rail  Green Line  https://www.transitc… Speci… special note unknown          2\n5 rail  Orange Line https://www.transitc… Norma… normal serv… normal           1\n6 rail  Pink Line   https://www.transitc… Norma… normal serv… normal           1\n7 rail  Purple Line https://www.transitc… Norma… normal serv… normal           1\n8 rail  Yellow Line https://www.transitc… Norma… normal serv… normal           1\n\n\nBecause the data set is small and some rail lines share identical status profiles, I set the number of clusters equal to the smaller of three and the number of distinct feature profiles to avoid specifying more clusters than unique data points.\n5.4 Visualizing Cluster Results\nPlot 1: Rail Lines by Cluster\n\nrail_clusters |&gt;\nggplot(aes(x = reorder(route, cluster), y = as.factor(cluster))) +\ngeom_point(size = 4) +\nlabs(\ntitle = \"K-Means Clusters of CTA Rail Lines\",\nx = \"Rail Line\",\ny = \"Cluster\"\n) +\ntheme_minimal() +\ntheme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot 2: Status Distribution Within Each Cluster\nThis plot compares how different clusters are composed in terms of service status categories.\n\nrail_clustered |&gt;\ncount(cluster, status_cat) |&gt;\nggplot(aes(x = status_cat, y = n, fill = as.factor(cluster))) +\ngeom_col(position = \"dodge\") +\nlabs(\ntitle = \"Distribution of Status Categories by Cluster\",\nx = \"Service Status Category\",\ny = \"Count\",\nfill = \"Cluster\"\n) +\ntheme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.5 Interpretation of Machine Learning Results\n\nThe k-means algorithm grouped rail lines based on how many alerts they had in each status category.\nLines with similar operational patterns appear in the same cluster.\nSome clusters may reflect lines experiencing primarily normal service, while others may reflect lines with more construction-related disruptions or operational delays.\nBecause the data set is a snapshot, clusters suggest short-term operational similarities, not long-term reliability trends.\n\n5.6 Fairness and Limitations\n\nSnapshot bias: The analysis reflects conditions only for the moment the HTML was scraped, not long-term performance.\nSmall data set: With limited alerts and a small number of rail lines, clusters should be interpreted cautiously.\nReporting bias: CTA’s website communicates certain alerts differently across lines. Differences in reporting may influence clusters.\nEquity implications: Lines serving marginalized communities could appear more frequently in “disrupted” clusters—however, drawing these conclusions responsibly requires historical and demographic data that is beyond the scraped data set.\n\nDespite these limitations, the machine learning approach offers a structured way to compare service conditions across rail lines using reproducible, data-driven methods."

    "text": "7.Ethics & Fairness Reflection\n7.1 Biases and Limitations in the Data set\nSeveral important limitations influence how this data set should be interpreted. First, the scraped rail alert data reflects only a single snapshot in time, rather than ongoing or historical service patterns. Because service conditions change frequently, this one-time view cannot reliably communicate whether certain lines consistently experience delays or disruptions.\nSecond, CTA service alerts are designed for public-facing communication, not analytically standardization. Different rail lines may receive different levels of detail or frequency of updates, resulting in potential reporting bias. Alerts may also vary in wording, making comparisons across lines difficult.\nThird, some rail lines may not appear in the data set at all if no alert happened to be posted at the time of scraping. This means the data set may under represent or misrepresent service reliability for certain communities. Finally, the alerts lack geographic context, demographic information, or time-based details such as duration or frequency of disruptions, limiting the ability to evaluate equity impacts.\n7.2 How These Biases Could Affect Decision-Making\nIf policymakers were to rely solely on this data set, the limitations could lead to incorrect or incomplete conclusions. A temporary disruption might appear to be a systemic issue, or chronic issues might not be visible in the snapshot. Lines serving neighborhoods with fewer posted alerts might appear more reliable even if this is not the case over time.\nBecause machine learning clustering in this project is based on the limited status categories available, its groupings reflect patterns in the alert text, not comprehensive operational performance. Without a broader data set, these clusters should not be used to guide major decisions about funding, scheduling, or maintenance priorities.\nThese biases highlight the need to avoid overgeneralizing and to frame any insights as exploratory and preliminary rather than definitive.\n7.3 Responsible Presentation of Findings to Policymakers\nFindings from this project should be presented to policymakers with clear transparency about data limitations. It is important to emphasize that:\n\nThe analysis is based on a single snapshot, not long-term performance.\nAlerts reflect CTA communication choices, not complete operational data.\nResults should be used to inform further investigation, not to make conclusive judgments.\nAdditional datasets—such as on-time performance logs, slow zone maps, and demographic overlays—would be needed for meaningful equity evaluations.\n\nA responsible presentation would frame the results as a starting point for deeper analysis, encouraging city officials to consider how better data collection, transparency, and reporting standards can improve transit planning and equity assessments."

    "text": "Reflection Memo\nOverview\nThis memo summarizes the purpose, approach, findings, and policy implications of the CTA rail service analysis project, written for civic and non-technical audiences such as city officials, nonprofit leaders, and community organizations.\nCivic Problem Addressed\nPublic transit reliability is a vital component of civic equity. When rail service is inconsistent or poorly communicated, communities that rely most on transit—often low-income residents, essential workers, and people without access to cars—face greater barriers to mobility. This project explores publicly available service alerts to understand how CTA rail lines differ in their reported service conditions and how such information might eventually support transit equity discussions.\nSteps Taken to Produce Findings\nThe project involved:\n\nScraping CTA’s public service alert webpage to collect rail-line status information.\nStandardizing service categories into broad groups such as normal service, minor delay, major delay, and service change.\nApplying machine learning clustering to identify patterns in how rail lines are described in public alerts.\nVisualizing the results to communicate differences in service descriptions across lines.\n\nAlthough the data set is limited, the workflow demonstrates how civic analysts can use reproducible methods to generate insights from publicly available transit data.\nKey Findings\n\nSome lines appear more frequently in alert data than others.\nService descriptions vary by line, suggesting differences in either operational reliability or communication frequency.\nMachine learning grouped several lines together based on similarities in their reported service categories.\nBecause the data set is a single snapshot, these findings should not be interpreted as long-term performance trends.\n\nEquity and Fairness Concerns\nThe analysis raises several equity considerations:\n\nMissing or inconsistent alerts may under represent service challenges faced by certain communities.\nSnapshot-based conclusions could obscure chronic issues or exaggerate temporary disruptions.\nWithout demographic or geographic context, it is not possible to determine whether transit burdens fall disproportionately on specific neighborhoods.\nThe language used in service alerts may itself be a source of bias.\n\nThese factors underscore the need for richer, longitudinal, and more transparent transit data.\nPolicy Implications\nWhile exploratory, the findings support several potential policy directions:\n\nImproved data transparency: CTA could publish standardized, historical performance metrics to support evidence-based decision-making.\nEnhanced communication consistency: Standardizing alert wording would assist both the public and analysts in interpreting service conditions.\nEquity-centered planning: Future analyses should integrate demographic data to ensure that transit investment decisions promote fairness.\nPredictive analytics opportunities: With a broader data set, machine learning could help anticipate rail-line disruptions and improve rider experience."

    "text": "This Quarto site presents a reproducible data analysis project examining CTA rail service conditions in Chicago. The goal of the project is to explore how public transit service reliability is communicated through CTA’s system alerts and to demonstrate how data science methods can support conversations about transit equity, operational planning, and transparency.\nThe project uses publicly available information from CTA’s “System Status & Alerts” webpage. The data was collected through web scraping, cleaned and categorized into meaningful service status types, and then analyzed using exploratory machine learning techniques. Although the dataset represents only a single point in time, the workflow highlights how civic analysts, students, and public agencies can use reproducible tools to better understand transit service patterns."

    "text": "Why Transit Equity Matters\nReliable public transportation is essential for equitable access to jobs, education, healthcare, and civic participation. In Chicago, many residents depend heavily on CTA rail service, and disruptions often disproportionately affect communities with fewer transportation alternatives.\nThis project focuses on the question:\nHow do CTA rail service alerts reflect differences in service conditions across rail lines, and what might these patterns suggest for transit equity and public communication?\nWhile the results are exploratory, they demonstrate how data-driven frameworks can support policy discussions around transportation equity, infrastructure investment, and public accountability."
